## Movie "Barcode" Generator

This python script takes every frame from a movie file and condenses them all down to a single pixelâ€™s worth of color. Laid out in a single resultant image, the results take on a abstract form that speaks of the tone and mood of the movie it depicts.

This script employs k-means clustering on each frame sampled to find the dominant color in each image, thus creating a simplier, more abstract appearing barcode than with other generators seen on the internet.
